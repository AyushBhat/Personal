### Introduction

Welcome to my little corner. Iâ€™ve been cleaning up since I am getting close to graduation. Graduation cleaning and all.
This is my itinerary:

1. Graduate
2. Get into more competition
3. Figure out what to keep and what to discard

### Work Projects
---
* Work code have been removed or merely referenced. 

### Competition
--- 
* "UVa Online Judge" sucks. Shouldn't be used to judge my coding. Even the book "Programming Challenges" thinks so. It takes several try sometimes and I have come to accept the fact that if it doesn't take my answer but the output matches, I'm going to accept it personally.
* TopCoder platform isn't what it used to be. It parses regex differently. What works on my compiler doesn't always work on their's for some reason. This issue has been brought up before by others.
* Poked around. Turns out regex is poorly implemented in a lot of C++ compilers.

### School Projects
---
* School project relates to work done at KCC or NYU. 
* Most of the code at KCC were in C++. 
* Most of the work at NYU were done in C/C++/Python. 
* My professors said to not put up their code. So...
* As a result, mostly for referencing.
