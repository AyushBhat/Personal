### Introduction

Welcome to my little corner. Iâ€™ve been cleaning up since I am getting close to graduation. Graduation cleaning and all. Please check out my wiki for more information.
This is my itinerary:

1. Graduate
2. Get into more competition
3. Figure out what to keep and what to discard

I think I will have lots of competition code up.
