### Introduction

When I asked Professor Sterling if I could put up my homework, he said not to, so.. and when I asked around, I understood why. (The other professors preferred that I didn’t.) So instead, I chose to put up descriptions. 

I just need time so I can do some clean-up. Instead of code request, I’m just going to put up alternative code to showcase skills. I’m nearing graduation so I have a bit of time after Spring 16.
