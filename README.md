### Introduction

Welcome to my little corner. Iâ€™ve been cleaning up since I am getting close to graduation. Graduation cleaning and all. Please check out my wiki for more information.
This is my itinerary:

<ol>
<li value="0">Graduate</li>
<li>Get into more competition</li>
<li>Figure out what to keep and what to discard</li>
</ol>

I think I will have lots of competition code up.
As time goes on, I'm trying to consolidate everything.
