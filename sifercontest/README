DON’T CHEAT. Go away. Unless you’re an employer, then feel free to look at my code and everything. Then hire me!

Also the judges on “UVa Online Judge” sucks. Even the book “Programming Challenges” thinks so. So if I try several times and it doesn’t take my answer but the output matches, I’m going to accept it. That’s right: Judge Sifer.

Not feeling TopCoder platform either. It seems to parse regex differently. What works on my compiler doesn't work on their's for some reason.

...

Poked around. Turns out regex is poorly implemented in a lot of C++ compilers.
